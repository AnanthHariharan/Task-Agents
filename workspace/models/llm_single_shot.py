    "2. Do NOT modify dialogue actions (i.e., Commander.Say() and Driver.Say() should remain unchanged).\n"
    "3. Add annotations for each non-dialogue action. Example: Driver.PickUp('Newspaper') â†’ 'Driver picks up the newspaper'.\n"
    "4. Mark actions that are unnecessary to achieve the goal with '# REMOVE' and a brief explanation. \n\n"
    "REMOVE tagging rules:\n"
    "- Add a '# REMOVE' tag to 'PickUp' actions involving objects irrelevant to the GOAL. If any object in a 'PickUp' action is irrelevant, also add '# REMOVE' to the next 'PlaceAOnB' action.\n"
    "- Do NOT mark a 'PickUp' action as REMOVE if the object is used for a relevant 'PourFromAIntoB' action later. For instance, picking up a mug to wash it or pouring liquid for a task should be kept.\n"
    "- Do NOT mark 'PlaceAOnB' actions as REMOVE unless the preceding 'PickUp' action was marked REMOVE.\n"
    "- Add a '# REMOVE' tag to consecutive 'Move' and 'Turn' actions that cancel each other out (e.g., 'Move(1.0)' followed by 'Move(-1.0)').\n"

    "Driver.PlaceAOnB('Egg', 'CoffeeTable'), // Driver places an egg on coffee table. # REMOVE: previous 'PickUp' action was unnecessary\n"
    "Driver.PickUp('Mug'), // Driver picks up the mug.\n"
    "Driver.PlaceAOnB('Mug', 'Sink'), // Driver places mug in the sink.\n"
